Q.3 The molar heat capacity of oxygen gas at STP is nearly 2.5 R. As the temperature is increased,
it gradually increases and approaches 3.5R. The most appropiate reason for this behaviour is that at high temperatures

a) Oxygen does not behave as an ideal gas
b) Oxygen molecules dissociate in atoms
c) The molecules collide more frequently
d) Molecular vibrations gradually become effective
