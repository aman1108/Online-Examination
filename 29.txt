Q.29	Which of the following statement is false?

(a)	The difference between rms velocity and mean velocity at any temperature for different gases diminishes as larger and yet larger molar masses are considered.
(b)	The square of the mean velocity of molecules is equal to square of the rms velocity at a certain temperature.
(c)	The ratio of the mean velocity to the rms velocity is independent of temperature.
(d)	The mean K.E. of the gas molecules at any given temperature does and depend on the mean velocity.
